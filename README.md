# 3D-Films: Scary Secrets Of The Film Industry 

# Overview
3D-Films conducted an in-depth review of movie data in order to provide informed advice to a prospective new entrant into the film industry. We parsed through box office numbers, film ratings, personnel, and genre representation to determine an optimized approach to building a cinematic empire. After conducting our analysis, we have determined that the strongest correlation for production budget to profit occurs in the highest tier of budget allocation, specifically above 100 million dollar budgets. That being said, all budget tiers were profitable. Secondly, we also determined that the Horror genre is an ideal genre for producing cost-effective films with a great track ROI track record. Our third insight is that using buzz-worthy personnel is useful for cultivating buzz and excitement amongst the public.

# Business Problem
A company approached 3D-Films asking for business insights and advice about the film industry. Our clients hope to compete with current industry leaders and other large companies who have recently entered the media business. We were tasked with finding three actionable insights to help make their entry to the business as impactful as possible.

# Success: 
Weâ€™ve set profitability or high investment return and high reviews as a metric of success in the film industry
>- What production budget yields high return?
>- What genre and release date?
>- And which creative personnel?

# Data Understanding
We parsed through several different sources of data. Our data was taken from a number of sites that track the movie industry. The data contained a tremendous amount of information including information regarding box office revenue, production budgets, release dates, and reviews from critics and regular people as well. We put profit first in our analysis, and then provided options to pursue depending on the clients' preferred budget, genre, or critical appeal.

# Conclusion

Based on our analysis, we have found that expenditure had strong correlation with profit, movies with high budget had highest turns in comparison to those with low budget. We also found that gloal premier yielded higher income compared to domestic or foreign returns. We de dived deeper into genres, low-budget horror and mystery movies tend to yield the highest return on investment (ROI).

Considering the financial risks associated with high-budget films, we recommend that a new film studio focuses on producing low to mid budget horror/thriller and mystery movies. By starting with these genres, the studio can minimize financial risks while still capitalizing on the high ROI potential the genre offers. This approach allows the studio to gain experience and establish a foothold in the industry before venturing into more expensive projects. This conclusion is based on the data we have examined, which indicates that these genres have a strong potential for profitability.

It is important to note that our analysis is based on the available data and industry trends. The success of any movie project depends on various factors, including marketing strategies, storytelling, and audience reception. However, by focusing on low-budget horror and mystery movies and aligning their release with the Halloween season especially to avoid competition with established studios releasing in the summer, a new film studio can increase their chances of achieving a higher ROI. Aiming for writers, directors, actors and actresses that are associated with movies with highest ratings is also a good strategy to maximize popularity and establish a strong presence in the industry.
